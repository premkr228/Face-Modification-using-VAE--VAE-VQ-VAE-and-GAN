# Face-Modification-using-VAE--VAE-VQ-VAE-and-GAN
Developed and compared VAE, β-VAE, VQ-VAE + PixelCNN, and DCGAN on the CelebA dataset for face reconstruction and synthesis. Evaluated reconstruction quality, disentanglement, latent controllability, and realism across models trained for 10 epochs, highlighting trade-offs between interpretability and photorealistic generation.
